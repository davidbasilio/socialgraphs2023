## Course Description

### What are Social Graphs?

Social graphs, also known as social networks or sociograms, represent relationships and connections between individuals or entities in a social system. These graphs are a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding various aspects of human interaction, such as friendships, collaborations, information flow, and influence propagation.

In this course, we will explore the fascinating world of social graphs, diving deep into their concepts, analysis techniques, and practical applications. By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of social graphs and how to apply graph theory to solve real-world problems related to social networks.
